# Addition Game
Simple addition game created in Python 2. Tested working in Python v2.7.18.

## Aim
Learning aids are toys that provide tactile, visual, auditory or kinesthetic stimuli to aid childrenâ€™s learning. An international toy manufacturer has asked for designs and prototypes to be submitted of learning aids suitable for kindergarten and elementary/primary schools.   

The learning aid can be either a physical toy or a software learning application.   

To design and develop a prototype or product that serves as a learning aid for young children, you can choose your target market between the ages of five and ten (Year one to year five or so) but you do need to identify a specific age range.

## Remarks
This project is submitted as part of an assessed coursework.

## Files
- `v1.0.0.py` contains the source code written in Python 2. Tested working in Python v2.7.18.
